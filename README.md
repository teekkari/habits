# Task Stack

## Introduction

Task Stack is a tool I've been developing for myself to help with procrastination and to also teach myself more web development (using React and NodeJS to be more precise). The point is to serve as a simple interface for quick note-jotting / todo-list creation.

* UX improvements
* Animations
* Switch DB when user support is done
