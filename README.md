# Task Stack

## Introduction

Task Stack is a tool I've been developing for myself to help with procrastination and to also teach myself more web development (using React and NodeJS to be more precise). The point is to serve as a simple interface for quick note-jotting / todo-list creation.

## Interface

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Start backend (Runs on localhost:8888)
    1. Run ```npm install``` in /backend/ folder
    2. Run ```npm start``` in /backend/ folder
3. Start frontend (Runs on localhost:3000)
    1. Run ```npm install``` in /backend/ folder
    2. Run ```npm start``` in /backend/ folder
4. Done!

## Technologies

### Frontend

* React
* materialize-css

### Backend

* NodeJS
* Express
* LowDB

## Future plans

**The application is still a WIP-project.**

Plans include:
* User support (login etc)
* UX improvements
* Animations
* Switch DB when user support is done
